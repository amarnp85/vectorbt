# üìö Multi-Symbol Portfolio Backtesting - Lessons Learned

## Executive Summary

After implementing both basic and advanced multi-symbol portfolio strategies, we discovered important insights about the trade-offs between simplicity and complexity in trading systems.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Basic Multi-Symbol Strategy Performance**
- **Total Return**: 42.62% (full example) / 17.77% (working example)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.74 / 0.542
- **Win Rate**: 55.6% / 57.1%
- **Max Drawdown**: -11.19% / -7.15%

### 2. **Advanced Multi-Symbol Strategy Performance**
- **Total Return**: 14.51% (when it generated signals)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.397
- **Win Rate**: 46.2%
- **Max Drawdown**: -7.98%

### 3. **Why the Basic Strategy Outperformed**

1. **Over-filtering**: The advanced strategy's multiple filters (RSI + volume + volatility + regime) were too restrictive
2. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Symbol-specific parameters need careful optimization
3. **Market Conditions**: 2023 was a trending year where simple trend-following worked well
4. **Complexity Cost**: More rules don't always mean better performance

## Valuable Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Symbol-Specific Parameters** ‚úÖ
```python
symbol_params = {
    'BTC/USDT': {'fast': 20, 'slow': 50},  # Slower for less volatile
    'ETH/USDT': {'fast': 15, 'slow': 40},  # Medium speed
    'SOL/USDT': {'fast': 10, 'slow': 30},  # Faster for more volatile
}
```
**Result**: Better signal timing for each asset's characteristics

### 2. **Correlation-Based Position Sizing** ‚úÖ
```python
if correlation > 0.7:
    position_size *= 0.5  # Reduce when correlated
```
**Result**: Reduced concentration risk (though no positions were actually reduced in our test)

### 3. **Market Regime Detection** ‚ö†Ô∏è
```python
bull_market = market_price > market_ma_50
# Only take longs in bull markets
```
**Result**: Mixed - reduced trades but also missed opportunities

### 4. **Multi-Timeframe Architecture** ‚úÖ
- Successfully implemented VBT's native multi-symbol support
- Proper DataFrame signal structure for all symbols
- Efficient simultaneous processing

## Practical Recommendations

### 1. **Start Simple, Add Complexity Gradually**
```python
# Phase 1: Basic MA crossover
# Phase 2: Add trend strength filter
# Phase 3: Add correlation sizing
# Phase 4: Add regime detection (if it improves results)
```

### 2. **Optimize Parameters Per Symbol**
```python
# Use backtester's optimization framework
for symbol in symbols:
    optimal_params[symbol] = optimize_symbol(symbol, data)
```

### 3. **Balance Filters Carefully**
Instead of requiring ALL conditions:
```python
# Too restrictive
entry = crossover & rsi_oversold & volume_high & trend_strong

# Better approach
entry = crossover & (rsi_oversold | trend_strong)  # OR conditions
```

### 4. **Focus on Risk Management**
The real value of advanced features:
- Correlation-based sizing prevents concentration
- Volatility filters avoid extreme conditions
- Market regime awareness for crisis protection

## Code Architecture Success

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **VectorBT Multi-Symbol Support**
   - Native DataFrame operations across symbols
   - Efficient signal generation
   - Proper cash sharing

2. **Module Organization**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Reusable components
   - Easy to test and debug

3. **Position Sizing Framework**
   - Flexible size adjustments
   - Risk-based allocations
   - Portfolio-level constraints

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

1. **Signal Validation**
   - Multi-symbol DataFrames trigger warnings
   - Need better unified signal interface support

2. **Parameter Optimization**
   - Need automated per-symbol optimization
   - Walk-forward validation for robustness

3. **Filter Interaction**
   - Better understanding of filter combinations
   - Adaptive filter thresholds

## Final Multi-Symbol Strategy Template

```python
def create_robust_multi_symbol_strategy(data):
    """Template for practical multi-symbol strategy."""
    
    # 1. Symbol-specific parameters (optimized)
    params = load_optimal_parameters(data.symbols)
    
    # 2. Generate base signals
    signals = {}
    for symbol in data.symbols:
        ma_fast = data.close[symbol].rolling(params[symbol]['fast']).mean()
        ma_slow = data.close[symbol].rolling(params[symbol]['slow']).mean()
        
        # Simple but effective
        signals[symbol] = {
            'entry': ma_fast.vbt.crossed_above(ma_slow),
            'exit': ma_fast.vbt.crossed_below(ma_slow)
        }
    
    # 3. Risk management layer
    correlations = calculate_rolling_correlations(data)
    position_sizes = adjust_sizes_by_correlation(correlations)
    
    # 4. Only add filters that demonstrably improve risk-adjusted returns
    if backtest_shows_improvement(regime_filter):
        signals = apply_regime_filter(signals, market_regime)
    
    return signals, position_sizes
```

## Conclusion

The journey from basic to advanced multi-symbol strategies taught us that:

1. **Simplicity often wins** - The basic MA crossover outperformed complex filters
2. **Risk management matters more than signal generation** - Focus on position sizing and correlation
3. **Test everything** - Filters that seem logical may hurt performance
4. **Architecture is crucial** - Good code structure enables experimentation

The advanced features we built (correlation sizing, regime detection, symbol-specific parameters) are valuable tools, but they should be applied judiciously based on backtesting evidence, not assumptions.

### Next Steps

1. **Parameter Optimization**: Run systematic optimization for each symbol
2. **Filter Testing**: A/B test each filter to measure its impact
3. **Market Regime Study**: Analyze when regime filters help vs hurt
4. **Correlation Dynamics**: Study how correlations change over time
5. **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Validate on 2024 data

Remember: The goal is not the most sophisticated strategy, but the most robust and profitable one.
